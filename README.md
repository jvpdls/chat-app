# Next.js + Socket.io Chat Application

This is a simple chat application based on the late Omegle. It connects two random users on the same chat room.

## Technologies

- Next.js 14.1.3
- Socket.io ^4.7.4

## Getting started

1. Configure `.env` with custom values if needed
2. install all dependencies: `npm run install-all`
3. build the front-end: `npm run build` (optional)
4. start the app and its API: `npm run dev` OR `npm start` if the front-end was built

## Chatting 

By default, the front-end will be loaded at `localhost:3000` and the API at `localhost:4000`.

To see the chat working, open the front-end host in two different tabs to simulate the interaction between users.
