# Next.js + Socket.io Chat Application

This is a simple chat application based on the late Omegle. It connects two random users on the same chat room.

## Technologies

- Next.js 14.1.3
- Socket.io ^4.7.4

## Getting started

### API

1. Navigate to the API folder: `cd api`
2. optional: configure `.env` with custom values if needed
3. install its dependencies: `npm i`
4. run the server: `npm run start` 

### Front-end

1. Navigate to the front-end folder: `cd front-end`
2. optional: configure `.env` with custom values if needed
3. install its dependencies: `npm i`
4. build the app: `npm run build`
5. run it: `npm run start` 

## Chatting

By default, the front-end will be loaded at `localhost:3000` and the API at `localhost:4000`.

To see the chat working, open two different tabs to simulate the interaction between users.
